How do Canadian Cities Compare to Each Other?

The Problem:
- What determines how similar Canadian cities are to each other (in terms of what types of businesses they attract)? Is it geographic location or city size?
- Are large cities across Canada more similar to each other? Or are they more similar to smaller cities within the same province?
- For example, is Toronto (largest city in Ontario) more similar to Vancouver (largest city in British Columbia) or to Peterborough (smaller city in Ontario).

Background:
- A successful business owner runs his business in a large Canadian city. He wants to expand to a new location in a new city. 
- Is his business more likely to succeed in a smaller city closer to the original location?
- Or is it more likely to succeed in another large city, farther away?

Caveat:
- This exercise will examine similarity of cities based on the types of venues that exist within them.
- Demographics, wealth, and personal business practices of the business owner will not be investigated at this time.
